What does it do?
================

This extension allows you to 

#. Manage the 404-Errorpage-Handling (you can select a page of the pagetree)
#. Have 404 Errorpages in multiple languages
#. Edit the RealUrl-Configuration (with Syntax-Check)
#. Load a sample configuration with strong defaults
#. Clear the RealUrl-Cache
#. Allow Umlauts in URLs (enable in extension manager configuration)

All configurations are saved in separate PHP-files. These files are included in typo3conf/AdditionalConfiguration.php.

=============
How to use it
=============
Just install, optionally fill in the extension manager configuration. You get a backend module, that should explain everything by itself.
